# Read-Math-Input
A program that reads math expressions and calculates the result

## Compatibility
This only works with C++17 or later. Structured bindings = good

## Roadmap
- [x] Read basic math input (PEMDAS)
- [ ] Add word functions (sin, ln, etc.)
- [ ] Add variables
- [ ] Make this a library
